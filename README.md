# SiiT - Student Information and Integrated Tracking

**SiiT** is a comprehensive system designed to help educators and students track academic performance over time. It allows the recording, updating, and viewing of student grades across various subjects and generates detailed reports to monitor academic progress.

---

## Features

- **Grade Tracking**: Track and store grades for multiple subjects across various grading periods (e.g., Midterm, Final).
- **Performance Reports**: Generate reports to view overall performance, average grades, and trends.
- **User Roles**: Differentiate between faculty and student users. Faculty can update grades, while students can view their grades and performance.
- **CRUD Operations**: Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for grades and performance records.

---

## Project Scope

- **Grade Entry**: Allows faculty to enter and update grades for students in various subjects.
- **Student Performance**: Students can view their grades and overall performance in the system.
- **Data Storage**: All data is stored securely in a relational database (MySQL).
- **Performance Reporting**: Faculty and students can generate reports of performance over various periods.
